DCT PIPELINED EXAMPLE

Required tool
  Xilinx VIVADO HLS 13.3 is used
  Synopsys VCS 2012
  Synopsys Design compiler 2013
  Synopsys PrimeTimePX 2012
  Nangate 45nm library


Build order (run each make.sh in following folders)
  1. copy nangate library and verilog simulation file to nangate_lib
     - NangateOpenCellLibrary.db
     - NangateOpenCellLibrary.v
     - NangateOpenCellLibrary_fast_ccs.lib
     - NangateOpenCellLibrary_low_temp_ccs.lib
     - NangateOpenCellLibrary_slow_ccs.lib
     - NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical_ccs.lib
     - NangateOpenCellLibrary_worst_low_ccs.lib
  2. HLS synthesis (./hls) 
     - after running script
     - open project with GUI and push analysis button on the menu 
       to create required input xml files 
  3. verilog simulation (./verilog)
  4. logic synthesis (./synth)
  5. gate level simulation (./gate)
  6. gate level power estimation (./power)
  7. collect outputs (run install.sh)
Output files
  1. HLS outputs 
     - hls/roki/solution1/.autopilot/a.o.3.bc
     - hls/roki/solution1/.autopilot/dct.adb.xml
     - hls/roki/solution1/.autopilot/dct.aemf
     - hls/roki/solution1/.autopilot/dct.verbose.rpt.xml
  2. gate-level power data
     - power/audi_pwr1.out
     - power/roki_pwr1.out
